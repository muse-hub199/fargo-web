    <h2>what is DTC550</h2>
    <p><strong><b>Most organizations today need a secure way
        to create ID cards. They also need an easy
        way to distribute them, and the flexibility to
        accommodate changes and growth. They need
        the Fargo DTC550.
        The Fargo DTC550 Direct-to-Card Printer/
        Encoder is exceptionally hardworking. Its
        heavy-duty construction makes it the right
        choice for high-volume card printing and
        encoding, allowing you to quickly print a
        variety of cards for multiple applications. You
        can even add an extra layer of durability with
        the optional Lamination Module, and extra
        security to your cards with holographic Visual
        Security Solutions™. The DTC550 is versatile,
        able to deliver the level of personalization and
        functionality your organization demands. And
        it’s surprisingly simple to use, with easy set up
        and intuitive operation, including a user-friendly
        SmartScreen™ to monitor print status.whenever you need to reconfigure your
        ID card issuance system. The DTC550 is
        one of the most versatile ID card printers
        available, handling a wide range of secure
        ID card applications; from on-demand
        photo IDs, to high-volume customer loyalty
        cards, to sophisticated access cards with
        embedded electronics.
        The DTC550 produces
        high-quality ID cards using
        two different Direct-toCard (DTC®) printing
        methods: dye-sublimation
        for vivid colors and
        accurate photographic
        images, and resin
        thermal transfer for
        sharp black text and bar
        codes that can be easily read by infrared or
        visible light scanners.
        You can order the DTC550 with either a singlesided or dual-sided print engine. With a variety
        of options, the DTC550 can save you time by
        printing, read/writing and laminating up to three
        different e-card technologies — plus magnetic

            its pride. HDP5000 produces ID cards with the
            highest image quality available. By printing
            a reverse image on the underside of HDP®
            Film, then fusing the film to the card surface,
            the HDP5000 creates an image quality that
            looks more like a sharp glossy photo than an
            ordinary ID badge.
            Printing on film instead of directly on the card
            means that the uneven surface of technology
            cards doesn’t compromise image quality. The
            HDP5000 can print up to the edge of smart

            printing process. In fact, it carries a lifetime
            warranty.
            Cards produced by High Definition Printing are
            inherently more durable and secure than other
            types of cards. They resist wear and tear by
            putting a durable layer of HDP Film between
            the card image and the outside world. They’re
            also tamper-evident — if a counterfeiter tries
